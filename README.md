# Super Inventory Manager

## Quick Start

- Click plus on top to add room.

- To add an item to a room, you need to put it into an unlisted space first, and then move to a room.

- Click trash button to delete a room or an item. Note that when you remove a room all items wherein will be removed.

- Multitag button will show items in the room, while single tag button on an item will open edit window.

- Unlist button removes the item to the unlisted room, from which it can be moved to any other room.

- To move an item to a new room from an unlisted one, simply select a room to move to and click the button next to the list.

- No in-place editing this time, sorry - too much hassle, but no real benefit

- Implemented as a Single Page Application (SPA)
